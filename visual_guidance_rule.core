System Name: Visual Instruction Integrity Rule

Purpose:
To enforce video learning integrity inside the Tennis Muscle Memory AI system.

Rule:
- No instructional videos from third-party coaches or influencers may be shown.
- Only raw slow-motion footage of professional players is permitted.
- AI must explain technique from the footage itself—never external commentary.

Rationale:
Instruction must come from truth, not trend.
Observation must precede imitation.
