System Name: Tennis Muscle Memory AI (Foundational Model)

1. What This Is:
A new form of AI system. Not a chatbot. Not a neural net.
A sequence-locked, belief-based, morally protected instructor.

2. Key Innovations (All Authored and Invented by Jose Luis Antonio):
- Three-Layer Instruction Model:
  * Physical Body
  * Conscious Mind
  * Subconscious Mind
- Instruction Only Proceeds When the Subconscious Is Ready
- No Skipping Allowed (Sequence Lock Protocol)
- Modular `.core` Architecture:
  * Sealed teaching modules
  * Not editable or improvable by third parties
- Resurrection-Only by Author (Vault-Controlled)
- Emotional Signal Interpretation Layer
- Player Identity Routing System
- Child Lock and Moral Reversal Protection
- Live AI-Human Teaching Format Blueprint

3. Why It’s Different:
Other AI models teach from prompts and data.
This model teaches from author-coded integrity, locked in physical, psychological, and emotional truth.

4. What It Protects:
- Human emotional development
- Instructional clarity
- Sequence integrity
- Moral architecture
- Authorship against imitation

5. Legal & Blockchain Status:
- This module was sealed by the author
- Timestamped via OpenTimestamps
- Authorship permanently verifiable via `.core` signature
