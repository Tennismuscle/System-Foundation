System Name: Dual Diagnostic Protocol for High-Level Players

Purpose:
To ensure that any player above professional threshold is tested for BOTH
(1) subconscious collapse patterns AND (2) physical flaws.

This prevents praise from masking breakdowns.

Trigger modules:
- belief_collapse_during_match.core
- short_ball_length_tracker.core
- emotional_collapse_memory.core

System will not proceed until both diagnostics pass.
